# Ed25519 curve

**!! Work in progress - be sceptical on accuracy !!**

Monero employs Ed25519 curve as a basis for its signature scheme.
 
However, Monero does not follow EdDSA reference signature scheme.

## Public key derivation

In relation to EdDSA, Monero derives public keys differently:

* Monero uses Keccak instead of SHA-512
* Monero uses private keys as scalars, not as seeds

## Signature scheme

In relation to EdDSA, Monero uses a different signature scheme.

## Implementation

For the curve itself, Monero uses Ref10 implementation by Daniel J. Bernstein.
