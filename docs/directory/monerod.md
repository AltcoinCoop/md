The Monero daemon is the piece of software that keeps you synced up with the Monero network. That's all it does, it doesn't know about "you" or "your funds" or "your transactions". If you want to do anything on the Monero network, and thus on the Monero blockchain, you have to talk to this daemon that will then talk to the network as a whole by rebroadcasting transactions you initiate. Similarly, if you want to get history from the blockchain, or the current memory pool of transactions, or outputs to mix with, you can ask the daemon for that information.
